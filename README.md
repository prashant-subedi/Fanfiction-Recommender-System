# Fanfiction-Recommender-System
This will be a hobby project for me. Will scrape the data from fanfiction.net and try out different alogrithms.

Note. I haven't done anything right now. Am building this repo motivate myself. 
PLAN
* Start with one category, probably harry potter, since it has lots of data.(And I love the series)
* First Task will be to build the scrapper. 
* Then will build a simple enough website.
* After this will tryout different alogrithms and compare performances.
